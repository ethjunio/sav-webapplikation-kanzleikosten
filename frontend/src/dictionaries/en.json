A total of 489 law firms participated in the survey conducted by gfs.bern on behalf of the SAV. The cost values are based on up to 256 data points from law firms. For digitalization steps where few firms provided cost data, medians are used, regardless of your law firmâ€™s specific values. This model is an estimate and serves as a guide to the digitalization costs of law firms.",
